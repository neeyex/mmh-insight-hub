MMH Custom Dashboard - Development Log
This document serves as the single source of truth for the development of the MMH client dashboard. It contains our core principles and a chronological log of all major actions and decisions.

Our Guiding Principles (The Mother Rules)
The Development Log: We will maintain a detailed log of every step, change, and decision in this file.

Security First: We will build with a security-first mindset, leveraging best practices like RLS and environment variables.

Clarity & Organization: All code will be clean, well-organized into components, and include detailed comments for easy understanding.

The "Genius MVP" Mindset: We will find the optimal balance between a lean, fast-to-market MVP and a scalable, impressive system.

Efficiency & No Bloat: We will write intentional code, refactor regularly, and avoid any unused or redundant features.

The North Star Rule: We will always ask: "Does this feature directly help our client generate more revenue or save time?" If not, we don't build it yet.

The Time Machine Rule: We will use Git for version control and make small, frequent commits with clear messages.

Project Log
DEV LOG: 2025-08-22 @ 01:55 AM IST
Action: Initialized the Next.js project (mmh-dashboard) and installed initial dependencies (@supabase/supabase-js).
Files Modified: Project-wide initial setup.
Reasoning: To establish the foundational boilerplate for the application, configured with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the src/ directory structure.

DEV LOG: 2025-08-22 @ 05:11 AM IST
Action: Deployed the paddle-webhook-handler Edge Function and configured the Paddle webhook to send subscription.created events to the live endpoint.
Files Modified: supabase/functions/paddle-webhook-handler/index.ts, supabase/functions/_shared/cors.ts.
Reasoning: To complete the automated bridge between the payment system (Paddle) and our backend (Supabase), concluding Phase 2 of the development roadmap.

DEV LOG: 2025-08-23 @ 03:31 AM IST
Action: Created the full authentication UI, including login, update-password, and auth-code-error pages, and protected the dashboard with middleware.ts.
Files Modified: All files within src/app/auth/, src/app/login/, src/app/update-password/, src/middleware.ts.
Reasoning: To build the complete, secure user interface for authentication and protect all private dashboard routes, concluding Phase 3.

DEV LOG: 2025-08-24 @ 05:50 AM IST
Action: Resolved persistent Tailwind CSS build errors by performing a full reset, installing stable v3 dependencies, and manually creating the tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js files. Updated globals.css with the full brand design system.
Files Modified: tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js, src/app/globals.css.
Reasoning: To establish a stable and fully integrated design system foundation for the application.

DEV LOG: 2025-09-02 @ 08:30 AM IST
Action: Engineered the complete set of impressive, production-ready dashboard pages. This includes the main Command Center, the three "smart" onboarding pages (fine-tuning, data-sources, connect-tools), the dynamic status, plan, billing, and deployment pages.
Files Modified: All files within src/app/dashboard/.
Reasoning: To build the complete, enterprise-grade client-facing UI, ensuring each page is dynamic, secure, and aligned with our brand's design system.

DEV LOG: 2025-09-02 @ 08:35 AM IST
Action: Architected and created the new agent_blueprints and submission_updates tables in Supabase and secured them with RLS.
Files Modified: (SQL in Supabase).
Reasoning: To create a more robust and scalable "Blueprint Vault" architecture. This separates initial blueprint data from subsequent updates, improving data integrity and security.

DEV LOG: 2025-09-02 @ 08:40 AM IST
Action: Created the tally-webhook-handler Edge Function and the sendgrid-client.ts shared helper. Upgraded the paddle-webhook-handler to use the shared helper.
Files Modified: supabase/functions/tally-webhook-handler/index.ts, supabase/functions/paddle-webhook-handler/index.ts, supabase/functions/_shared/sendgrid-client.ts.
Reasoning: To build the complete automation and notification system. The Tally webhook handles automatic status updates, and the "Admin Briefing" system now proactively notifies you of all new clients and blueprint submissions, ensuring you have full visibility into your operations.
